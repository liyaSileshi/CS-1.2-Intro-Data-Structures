Okay, so, I'm just your standard, regular ol' incredibly handsome, unbelievably charismatic black dude.
Now, this drooling, pigment-challenged, mixed-race woman is my wife, Rainbow.
And, despite what she looks like right now, she's a doctor.
We're lucky.
We've got a great house, four great kids, and my Pops.
It's a far cry from where it all began.
That's why I promised my parents I'd get an education, graduate, and get myself out of there.
I guess for a kid from the hood, I'm living the American Dream.
The only problem is, whatever American had this dream probably wasn't where I'm from.
And if he was, he should've mentioned the part about how when brothers start getting a little money, stuff starts getting a little weird like in my neighborhood.
Sometimes I feel like a bit of an oddity.
And if you look to your left, you'll see the mythical and majestic Black Family out of their natural habitat and yet still thriving.
Go ahead and wave.
They'll wave right back.
- They're smiling.
Hi.
Hello.
- The little ones are cute.
They're just just amazing.
Sometimes I worry that, in an effort to make it, black folks have dropped a little bit of their culture and the rest of the world has picked it up.
They even renamed it "Urban".
And in the "Urban" world, Justin Timberlake and Robin Thicke are R&B Gods, Kim Kardashian's the symbol for big butts, and asian guys are just unholdable on the dance floor.
Come on! Big butts? R&B and dancing? Those were the black man's go-tos! I'm definitely not complaining.
I love my life.
And not that I want to go back to the days of being the big scary black guy.
But I have to admit it did kind of have its advantages.
SO1EO1 "Pilot" Even though we were close, my Pops had a weird way of showing he loved me.
Hey, Pops.
Hey, hey, son, can I just get some coffee in me before you start with all that mess? And by "weird," I meant he didn't show it at all.
- Good morning, Zoey.
- Hey, dad.
Are you wearing that awful cologne again? - Why? - Because it smells like you're wearing the awful cologne again.
Did seem like a pretty straightforward question there, son.
Right? Nice try.
I'm not gonna let you ruin my day.
Good morning, Mr.
Senior Vice President.
- Mwah! Hey.
- Hey, baby.
Hear that, Pops? Stevens is announcing my SVP promotion at work today.
Yeah, and if you'd have joined that black firm, like I told you, you'd have been Mr.
President five years ago.
Yeah, but for half the money.
So? It's a black company.
You got to make an adjustment for the negro inflation tax.
Pops, I am gonna be the first black SVP at Stevens & Lido.
This job is about more than just money to me.
It's about breaking down barriers.
Yeah.
Breaking down barriers equally important to money.
But just so that I'm clear, there is a salary increase, right? - Okay.
- Yes, baby.
All right.
Hey, Junior.
Mm, mm, mm, mm! Unh! - All right, all right.
Let's go.
- All right.
Oh, why don't y'all go get a room? I can't believe I marched on Washington and fought for my country to watch y'all do that mess.
You shot yourself in the foot to get out of the army.
And you were in D.
C.
for an Isley Brothers concert.
- You shot yourself? - Can we see? - Look here.
- Pops.
I want to see! Why do you have to get to school so early, son? Oh, uh, tryouts are today.
I want to get a little extra work in so I'd be ready.
Okay.
Work on the handle.
Lock down that point-guard spot.
Um there's no point guards in field hockey, dad.
Field hockey?! Man, isn't that a woman's sport? Nope.
Um, a lot of people think that, though.
A lot of people never think about field hockey, man.
What happened? We were hoopin' all summer long.
I thought you were gonna try out for the team, show these valley glen boys The Johnson Family jumper.
The Johnson Family wha dad, you didn't hit one jump shot all summer.
Hey.
It's not about the accuracy, son, all right? The family is known for our form.
Look at that.
Look at that elbow.
Look at that.
Right.
Anyway, I thought about playing hoop, but all my friends are fee-hocking it this year, so I figured, you know, when in Rome W when in Rome? You are not in Rome! You're in L.
A.
! You know what? I'm not gonna let you ruin my day.
Field hockey.
- What's up, Mr.
J? - What's up, Zach? - What's up, Andy? - What's up? "Andy"? That's not even close to "Andre".
I think it says I'm edgy but approachable.
I think it says, "I hate my father and I play field hockey".
Well, Zach thinks it's cool, and it's also a derivative of "Andre".
We discussed it, and I think I like that There were so few of us at Stevens & Lido that being black made you feel like you were part of a little family.
So when one of us made it, it was kind of like we all did.
Who do you think you are? And right now, I was that one.
I'm not saying I was the Jackie Robinson of Stevens & Lido advertising or anything, but, I mean, if other people were saying it, they wouldn't be wrong.
Hold on a second.
- Killer Kris.
- Big Dre, what up? Or should I say "Mr.
Senior Vee-peezy"? This is my assistant, Kris.
Notice how I do the shake with him.
That's because I consider him an honorary brother.
- Hey, Kris, let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.
Did you ever want to play the same sport your dad played in high school? Are you kidding? Of course.
My dad was a frickin' field-hockey God.
Meeting's in 10.
Whatever.
Yo! Dr.
Dre! This is Josh.
Um not an honorary brother.
Just "Andre".
All right, sorry, "Andre", hey bro Uh-oh, I mean Andre, listen, we're working on this folgers copy, and we wanted to know how you think a black guy would say "good morning".
Hmm.
Probably just like that.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Hey, hey, Stevens called a meeting, and I think something big might be up.
- Really? - Yeah.
You know, I'm hearing "historic," "game-changing" being tossed around.
Could just be office gossip.
Ha ha! If I could have your attention At Stevens & Lido, there was a clear separation between lower management and upper management.
And that always made me feel like it was us - versus them.
- get ready to work.
Even our snacks were divided.
We get cheetos and grape soda, while they always get what looks like a medieval feast! Let's eat, let's eat! Ha ha.
That's why this promotion was such a big deal.
For once, one of us was going to get a chance to be one of them.
More wine! More wine! To us! Like my daddy said, you chase a squirrel, you better be prepared to eat his nuts.
All right, uh I'm sure you've all heard I have an announcement.
Uh, myself and the board have decided to up a new Senior Vice President here in the company.
What?! ha ha! That's crazy! Oh, my God! Hey, hey, but very wise.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And this new SVP will also be heading up our creative presentation to grab the $250 million L.
A.
tourism account.
All right.
It is a big deal for us.
We need a home run here.
Sabrina, I'm not gonna forget about you when I become one of them, all right? Excuse me.
Excuse me.
All right.
- Uh, excuse me.
Yeah.
- change who we are.
So, without any further ado, I would like us all to give a warm congrats to the SVP of our new Urban division, Andre Johnson! Huh?! That's right.
- Andre! - Uh, I'm I'm sorry.
Uh did you say "Urban"? Urban division.
Wait.
Did they just put me in charge of black stuff? I don't like the social media at the table - Junior, pass the hot sauce.
- I told you that.
Okay.
Hello! Okay.
To my husband, Senior Vice President.
- Yes! - Yeah! - Congrats to my son! - Yeah! Finally made it, son.
- Finally made it - Holla! To head puppet of the white man.
Oh, Pops.
Come on.
You're here to celebrate him.
Actually, you told me I was coming over to eat fried chicken.
- I have no idea what the hell this is.
- It's fried chicken.
- Really? - It's baked fried chicken.
Oh, so fried fried chicken is too black for you.
- Pops! Pops, seriously? - Hey, hey.
Babe, babe.
- What? - You know what? Pops is right.
You know, I I do feel like a puppet.
As you should.
I said I wanted to be the first black SVP for Stevens & Lido, when, actually, I wanted to be the first SVP who happened to be black.
What's the difference? Obama's the first black president.
I mean, does that make him any less president? No.
No, because he's the first black president of the United States, not the first black president of the Urban United States.
Obama's the first black president? What you're doing a bang-up job over here.
No, no, no.
Hold on a second.
Let's explore this.
Jack, did you really not know that Obama was the first black president? He's the only president I've ever known.
- "Only".
Did you hear that? "Only".
- He gets a pass.
So that explains his complete lack of Presidential Trivia.
Hey.
You two.
You knew that Obama was the first black president, right? - I g guess.
- Okay.
"Okay"? Mm-hmm.
See what I'm talking about? Baked chicken.
- What you doing? - Looking at pictures of my Urban family.
Oh, my God.
You got to stop with the whole pity-party thing.
You don't think I go through this kind of thing all the time being a female doctor? It's not that big of a deal.
You got to keep it real.
- "Keep it real".
O okay.
- That's what I said.
All all this coming from, uh, a biracial or mixed or omni-colored-complexion, whatever-it-is-they're- calling-it-today woman - who technically isn't even really black? - Okay, well, if I'm not really black, then could somebody please tell my hair and my ass? - Babe, you don't get it.
- No.
- This is how it starts.
- What? Babe, Junior wants to play field hockey.
- I know.
What's wrong with that? - I today, it's field hockey.
Tomorrow, he's running from the police in a white bronco.
Oh, my God are you suggesting that our son is gonna grow up and murder his wife? - Aha! You think O.
J.
did it! - Oh, come on.
We can't have a keeping-it-real conversation with that attitude.
No, no, no.
Stop, babe.
- Baby, the gloves didn't fit! - No, focus, Dre.
- You need to focus.
- Okay.
This is what you always wanted.
This is your dream and this is our plan.
We're gonna climb the Himalayas, sex in the Louvre, and then we're gonna successfully raise our family in a better situation than we had.
If you pass up this promotion, we're 0 for 3.
Maybe you're right, babe.
- Ooh.
Thank you.
I love you, too.
- Ooh.
You're welcome.
Mwah.
I love you.
- No.
- You didn't even let me get it out.
I know, 'cause I can hear what you're thinking.
- Okay, well, I'm just gonna do it.
- No.
no! There he is my main man.
Can't wait to see what you do with that presentation.
Me too.
Really looking forward to it.
And, remember, really put your swag on it, you know? Keep it keep it real.
Keep it real? Yeah.
Be honest, be smart, be you.
What, uh, what did you think I meant? I thought you meant that.
Okay.
"Keep it real".
What's up, Drigitty-Dre? - * Rewind * - My name's not - Drigitty-Dre-Dre what? Kick it.
- That's inappropriate! Highly inappropriate! - Hey, babe.
- Mommy, mommy.
- Mom.
- Yeah? Liza Jackson asked if we could have a playdate.
She's weird, so feel free to say "no".
Liza Jackson? Which one is she? You know, wears the Nemo shoes every single day? And the polka-dot backpack.
Kind of smells like a Turkey Burger.
Wait a second.
Are you guys talking about the only other little black girl in your class? - Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Why didn't you just say that? - I don't know.
Guess when I hear "Liza Jackson," I just think "Nemo and Turkey Burgers".
- Yep.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
What? Don't you think that's beautiful? They don't see color.
No.
I think they need to be tested.
But when I say it, I'm wrong.
I made the team! Whoo! Yes! Oh, my goodness! - That's so exciting! - Of course you did.
- Yes! Oh, God, I'm so happy! - Thank you.
Uh, Zach? Can I help you with something? Uh, yeah, I've just been craving some grape soda all day, and my parents just never buy any.
- And why would you assume we have - Found it! Oh, and, dad, me and some of the field mob decided what I should do - for my birthday party.
- Field mob? - I want to have a Bar Mitzvah.
- A And before you say anything, I know we're not Jewish, but Zach knows a rabbi who's great at pushing through conversions, so Hold on so you'd be willing to forsake your own religion to have a party? Short answer yes.
- Are you listening to this? - Dad, now that I think about it, if I do, you won't have to worry about anyone calling me "Andy" anymore, because when I convert, I'll get a Hebrew name.
I'm gonna go with either "Scholomo" or "Shmuel".
- What? - Both pretty solid, bro.
Shut up! Shut you know what? Family meeting! Everybody, 'round the table now! I smell a group hug coming on.
I'm going to the track.
See you later, Pops.
All right, listen up.
I may have to be "Urban" at work, but I'm still going to need my family to be black.
Not Black-ish - Wha - but black.
So we're gonna start with some strict guidelines.
So, then he sent me a smiley face with a wink.
- I mean, I should be offended, right? - Zoey! - I'll text you.
- Alright.
From heretoforth, we are going to keep it real.
So, Junior, if I hear anybody calling you "Scholomo" or "Shmuel" or especially "Andy," I'm gonna back you over and whoever else is saying it in my car.
- Dad - Quiet! Now, I may have to watch you play possibly the dumbest sport in the world, but I do not have to sit back and listen to you rave about other kids' Bar Mitzvahs.
So, next Saturday, when you turn 13, you're becoming a man, too a black man, because I'm throwing you an African rites of passage ceremony.
That does not sound as fun.
No, it does not.
Okay, I have an idea.
Why don't we take a black break and go get some white yogurt? - Yeah! - Yeah! Hey, hey! Hold on, hold on.
Slow your roll, you two.
From here on out, I'm gonna need you two to describe people using keeping-it-real identifications.
"The assailant was a hispanic male between the ages of 10 and 60".
See? Now I know who I'm looking for.
Mommy, daddy's scaring me.
Me too, baby.
Me too.
Really? Okay, are we done with this whole life-and-death, keeping-it-real speech? Because I need to start prepping for a and I'm not gonna be thinking about keeping it real.
I'm gonna be thinking about keeping him alive.
You're not the only one in this house with an important job.
My job is pretty important.
And, as I recall, you were the one who brought up this keeping-it-real argument.
- So this is my fault? - Yes, it's your fault.
- Oh, this is my fault? - Oh, yes.
And, tomorrow, I have a very important presentation to make.
And you know what I'm gonna do when I go in there? I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna keep it real as Yeah, because that's what you told me to do.
Oh, I'm pretty sure that's not what I told you to do.
Oh, no, that's exactly what you said.
If she thinks I'm finished with keeping it real, I am just getting started.
And if Stevens & Lido really wants an Urban SVP, i'll give them their Urban SVP.
- Ha! - Oh, my God.
Lalonde Leonard landing at will.
And Lalonde goes down! _ So, that's my Urban pitch for the L.
A.
tourism account.
Thoughts? We're not really doing this, right? I thought it was funny.
Operation "Keepin' It Real" was in full effect, and although it was off to a rocky start, I still had high hopes.
Andre.
- Yes? - What is this mess you're doing? This ain't no mess, Pops.
This is our culture.
This ain't our culture.
We black, not African.
Africans don't even like us.
Dad, can I go? No.
Stand right there and experience your roots.
You're better off watching "Roots".
Should I start, or do you want to? Okay.
Okay.
Uh, take that, son.
Take that! - What is he doing? - Don't look at me.
Hey, Bow.
Look, baby, I had the boy wanted a Bar Mitzvah! Bow, I could use your support right now.
I was trying to support you when I called you at work today, and my call was rerouted to Corporate Security.
And they questioned me for like 30 minutes about my husband's mental state.
Hmm.
Weird.
Next time, just call my cell.
Ohh.
Dre, what happened at work today? Look, Mr.
Stevens failed to fully grasp the irony of my pitch, so we mutually decided that we would take the weekend to figure out if Stevens & Lido was still a perfect fit for me.
Still a perfect fit? Dre? He's thinking about firing you? I guess, if you want to oversimplify it like that.
Oh, my God.
Dre! There is no winning with you! You're upset because they gave you the job because you're black.
If they'd given it to someone white, you'd be upset they didn't give it to someone black! This "keeping it real" B.
S.
has got to stop.
I'm not gonna have you running around torturing my son.
What was that? What are you wear what are you wearing? Whatever issues you are working through, you need to get over them now.
Okay? Nice shot.
So much for The Johnson Family form.
Dad, listen, I get it.
You feel like I'm turning into a white boy.
But I'm not.
I'm just being me.
I'm just not quite sure who that is yet.
Son, I realize how difficult it must be to feel like the different one at school.
But it's also important for you to hold on to your culture and realize how special it is.
Honestly, the only thing I'm really trying to hold on to right now is my first boob.
I'm a ninth-grader playing varsity.
That means something.
So this was all a part of your plan.
Yeah.
Me and the field mob Hey, son, please stop calling yourselves that.
Fine.
Me and my boys figured that if we could just get our foot in the door with other jocks, we'd really get in there and make some noise.
So, you really do want to play basketball.
Yeah, dad.
But I suck at it.
All right, little man, get in the house.
Go.
Who knew? Boy wants to hold a boob.
You can't be mad at him for that.
Hey, Pops, how the hell did you keep it real with us - when we were growing up? - I didn't.
I kept it honest.
So, I really screwed this up, didn't I? Screwing things up is just another part of what it means to be a father, Dre.
It's how you learn to fix things.
Just remember, son, whatever you do, make sure it's right for who you are.
If that boy wants a Bar Mitzvah, I'm gonna throw that boy a Bar Mitzvah.
There you go.
"Hold a boob".
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present Andre Jr.
's Hip-Hop Bro Mitzvah.
.
Sometimes keeping it real means admitting you were wrong but, as a dad, still finding a way to be right.
Be damned if I'm calling him Andy, though.
So, that Los Angeles tourism campaign went a lot better once I realized that "Urban" can also mean Hip, Cool, and Colorful, just like my family.
So, taking a cue from my very wise son, I decided to get my foot in the door and really make some noise.
And just like that, I became the SVP of Stevens & Lido's Urban Division.
The funny thing is I didn't feel Urban.
I just feel like a dad.
who was willing to do whatever he had to for his family.
And isn't that the American Dream?

Dre: Every garage eventually turns into a family museum full of forgotten treasures.
Oh-ho, babe! Look what I found! - (Gasps) - The twins' onesies from our "we're in the White House" party! - So cute.
Wow.
- Oh, wow! I spilled a whole lot of kir royale on our babies.
(Laughs) And mixed in with all those memories, there's always something that's better off left buried.
Babe, this entire box is filled with your hair experiments.
Look at this.
Oh, relaxer.
(Laughs) All your picks.
(Laughs) Styling "gelÃ©e.
" - It laid it down.
It laid it down.
- Yeah, it did, but it's gone now.
But every now and then, amidst the garbage, you stumble across that one timeless gem.
- Hey.
- Hmm? Look at this.
- Let me see.
- Junior's old mitt.
Oh, my goodness.
I remember the day I realized that he was not going to make me a proud father on the baseball field.
- Oh, wow.
They grow up so fast.
- I'm telling you.
Whoa, whoa, where are you going? I'm gonna go play catch with my son before it gets too late, like "cat's in the cradle.
" Hey, Junior! Look what I found in the garage! Your old baseball - Dad, no! No! - (Screams) (Screams) (Screaming) - (Groaning) - Go! Go! Turns out, the cat was out of the cradle, and it winked right at me.
SO1EO2 "The Talk" So, after you bailed on the garage, I gave everything to the gardener, so don't be surprised if you see Pedro wearing a Jheri Curl.
You okay, babe? You having a little traffic jam? I'm fine.
You pulled something playing catch yesterday, didn't you? (Scoffs) Stretching does not make you gay, Dre.
I accidentally walked in on Junior, as he was engaged In hand-to-gland combat.
(Chuckling) Oh, God.
He's been doing that for a while.
He was even afraid he was gonna break it from doing it too much.
- Adorable.
Oh, my God.
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
He came to you with this? - Yeah.
When we had the talk.
- You and Junior had the talk without me? Babe, how could you keep me out of the sex-talk loop? Dre, please.
You are uptight with this kind of thing.
I mean, look at the way you wear a towel.
_ _ Just because you grew up in a houseful of naked hippies doesn't make you Dr.
Ruth.
My parents talked to us openly about everything, and that's why the kids come to me.
- Uh, hmm.
- It's what I do, and I do it pretty good.
Zoey hasn't said two words to you all month.
- She's going through a phase.
- Uh-huh.
She'll talk to me if it's about something big, unless you want to talk to her about her menstrual cramps.
- I just might.
- Okay.
Right after I get into the sex-talk loop with Junior - Mm-hmm.
- Hater.
- (Bottle sprays) - Ow! There's my boy A boy about to become a man with the sexual wisdom only a father can throw down After work.
I can't believe this is happening to me.
I'm devastated.
- Devastated! - Is everything okay, hon? - (Scoffs) Mm-hmm.
- Oh.
It's so not okay.
I mean, I'm seriously gonna cry all night.
Sounds kind of big.
You know you can always talk to me.
- I'm fine, mom.
- Okay.
Kill me.
I can honestly not I'm just saying, I'm that type of mom.
I'm very open.
You know, my parents never wore clothes, so (chuckles) It's nothing.
It's totally world-ending.
- Meet me in the bathroom.
Bring tissues.
- What (Sighs) He actually said that? Have a great day, sweetheart.
Hey, Dre.
How's life? Ah, well, this L.
A.
tourism account is really No, no, no, no, no.
Not work life Life life.
You are, uh you're part of my inner circle now.
Hearing that validates the struggle of my entire journey.
And H.
R.
says if I occasionally ask about your personal lives, it reduces the risk of an office shooting.
Okay, well, since you asked, you have a son, right? - Uh-huh.
- How did you go about giving him the talk? Oh, the "stop being rude to your It is a minefield.
No, no, no.
I mean the sex talk.
Oh, that was easier.
I just told him what my father told me.
- What? - "Out of state, out of mind.
" (Chuckles) You know, my pops never gave me the talk.
Hell, I didn't see him without his shoes on till I was 30.
Oh, well, don't worry, Dre.
You got this.
You'll figure it out.
You always do.
Mom I know I'm in your space.
Just ignore me while I put away all your clothes for you.
No, um, do you remember that thing I was talking about in the car this morning? Um I think so.
Maybe.
I could really use your advice.
Oh! Well, I'm sure I could squeeze you in before I go in there and scrape the boogers off Jack's headboard.
(Chuckles) Okay, well, listen to this craziness.
- So, this girl said I took - Rainbow: I knew she'd come to me.
Why wouldn't she? I'm such a good mom.
- (Speaking indistinctly) - She's lucky to have me.
"Zoey hasn't said two words to you all month.
" Suck it, Dre.
- Anyway, what should I do? - What, now? About everything I just said.
You got any advice? Uh whew.
(Chuckling) It's a lot to chew on.
It's like it's a lot of facets to this one.
You know, it's like a little diamond.
I'm gonna I'm gonna get back to you.
I'm gonna think about it, so okay? I'll be right back.
I'm gonna get back to you.
(Exhales sharply) - Oh, you tweaked your neck again, huh? - Huh? See, that's 'cause you don't stretch.
- I know it looks a little gay, but it works.
- What? I'm about to go upstairs and give Junior the talk.
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, pops, - how come you never gave me the talk? - I most certainly did.
I mean, what do you think that box of condoms I left in your bedroom was about? That was it? Oh, you wanted a hug, too? Son, listen to me.
Don't get all caught up in this "have an open dialogue with your kids" hoopla.
It's not natural.
Show me one place in the Bible where a kid talks.
And for God's sake, put some shoes on.
(Scoffs) Dre: So, nobody was any help Pops, my boss.
I was on my own with Junior.
Hey, son! It's your father! I'm coming in in 5 4 Come in, dad.
Whoo.
Okay.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
I guess I should have locked the door.
All right.
No need to apologize.
You're a man, and that's what men do.
Not me as much.
Let's talk about it Anything and everything.
Let's get our sex talk on.
Oh, uh, mom covered it all pretty good.
Yeah, maybe about the birds and the bees, but I'm your daddy, son, and I'm here to keep it one hundred.
All right, despite the fact that your mother thinks I'm uptight.
Cray-cray, right? (Chuckles) I'm comfortable.
(Chuckles) I'm gonna show you how comfortable I am.
Mm-hmm.
(Sighing) What's that? Just a comfortable man with no shirt on, talking to his son about nasty stuff.
(Chuckles) Ooh, really feeling the A.
C.
in here.
Am I standing under a vent? (Indistinct conversation in distance) Trying to do telekinesis again? You don't have it.
I left my karaoke mike in there, but I heard dad's giving Junior "the talk.
" What talk? I don't know.
So, let's talk next level.
So, what's it like, having sex? Whoa! Just gonna Just gonna jump right in there like that, huh, son? Okay, uh, I guess we're really doing this, huh? Let me figure this out.
Uh Well, where do we start? Body spray.
Bad name.
All right? Son, if you want to attract a woman, you never spray this on your body.
All right? You just spray it in the air like that.
And you walk through it.
Whoo! (Chuckles) That's cold.
(Chuckles) Kind of tingles when you're topless.
You getting all this, son? You need a notebook or something? I want the talk.
Me too.
I need the talk.
I think he's getting it because he's always in his room with the door closed.
Oh, really? Well, three can play at that game.
Now what? Now we wait.
But your date could keep kosher, so don't lean too heavy on the Oyster card.
All right? Hey, don't worry.
It all gets easier when you can drink.
You don't have to raise your hand, son.
Dad, I appreciate all this advanced dating advice, - but there's other stuff.
- Hmm.
Okay.
I heard some kids talking about oral.
Oh.
Okay.
Um I would stay away from that.
You know, a kid like you with wheat allergies.
All right, um So, show me which one of your crew has the most busted face.
Okay? Because that's gonna be your wingman.
By yourself, you're beautiful.
But next to him, you'll be Denzel Clooney Kodjoe chestnut.
(Grunting) 1 2 3.
Okay, I just needed to do three.
Finally, son, when it comes to movie dates, never pick a movie that'll make you cry.
That means no urban coming-of-age stories.
The brother always gets shot at the end.
Good talk, son.
(Door opens) Nailed it! So, after a day of dishing out sweet knowledge to my boy, I rewarded myself with a cinnamon stick while letting bow chew on her defeat.
The boy drank deep from the Dre well today, baby.
I will accept my apology in words or (Clicks tongue) Apology for what? Because somebody said that I couldn't do it, that it wasn't in me, but it is.
Now, who do I e-mail to give a T.
E.
Di.
sex talk? - So, what did you talk about? - The fundamentals.
Like what? - Signature fragrance boom.
- Mm-hmm.
Fly outfits boom.
And how to navigate urban terrain double boom.
(Chuckles) Great, so you taught our kid how to be a pimp? Baby, I think you're confusing "pimp" with "player.
" You know, that's a common two-parent-home mistake.
So, basically, Junior had a heart-to-heart with ice-t.
Babe, I had the sex talk with our son, shirt off.
Why was your shirt off? Because I'm free.
(Laughing) You're not free.
- Oh, you're laughing.
Okay.
- I'm laughing.
Well, if you want a good-night kiss, you know where to find me and my sweet cinnamony lips.
(Sighs) You're really not gonna come over here and get none? Babe, they're like two baked apples just lying on my face.
We've been in here for a whole day, and no one's given us the talk.
(Scoffs) That's it.
Time to make something happen.
Plus, I really got to pee.
(Sighs) - Hey! - Hey.
Hey, so, I was thinking really hard about everything that you told me yesterday about (Slurping coffee) Hmm? - What are you talking about? - Mm, mm.
It's just that, you know, with all the The craziness about (Muffled) You know? So hmm? (Speaking indistinctly) - Mom? - No? Hmm? It's super rude to talk with food in your mouth.
Of course, yes.
- I mean, you know? - (Cellphone vibrating) - Hmm.
- Oh.
(Chuckles) - More drama from you-know-who.
- (Muffled) Oh, I know who.
I you don't have to tell me about them.
(Sighs) - Mom? - Hmm? We're wondering if we could talk You know, "talk" because Not now.
I'm trying to be a good mom who listens better.
Maybe we should do something to get the talk.
Something good or something bad? You take good.
I'll take bad.
- I want bad! - We'll flip for it.
Heads, I win.
Tails, you lose.
Deal! Come on, heads! No wait.
Tails! No wait.
Tails? There's a supreme satisfaction a man attains when he's opened the door of knowledge to his son.
Hey, dad, can we have another talk? What? But I may have accidentally opened a revolving door.
Hey, what are you doing? Our sex-talk ritual.
We had the sex talk yesterday, man.
Remember? I nailed it.
Yeah, but I just have some follow-up questions.
Ohh.
I heard these seniors talking about a position called the triceratops.
What is that, exactly? To be honest, son, I can't keep up with all that new stuff, especially being married.
Let's Google it.
T-r-i-s It's with a "C.
" Uh, don't care.
Auto correct.
Spelling is for suckers.
(Chuckles) Oh! Oh, delete! Delete search history! - Oh, my God! - What was it? - Can we talk about it? - Uh I have other questions, too.
Aren't you gonna take your shirt off? I'm a little too bloated to go shirtless right now.
I could go talk to mom.
Yeah.
Well, hey, hey, ho.
No, no.
Remember, I'm your guy.
(Sighs) All right, look, I'll meet you upstairs in an hour.
All right.
Just knock first.
Oh.
Oh, trust me, I will.
- Hate to say I told you so.
- No, you don't.
You would marry "I told you so" and have a baby with it and buy adjoining burial plots.
Just saying.
You opened Pandora's box and a triceratops jumped out.
(Laughs) So, she said those exact words? Ugh! I just want to scream! Oh, I feel you, sweetheart.
Oh, I mean, the whole thing just drives me nuts.
Ohh! (Sighs) But you know what? Sometimes it helps if you play the whole thing out from the other person's perspective.
You know, it'll help give you clarity so you can resolve it.
So, I, like, just think it all through from the other side? Yes.
Uh, but you want to, um You want to say it out loud so you hear the emotional nuances.
You know? That's the important part out loud.
Okay, so, here it goes.
So, last week, there's this girl named Zoey who has an Rainbow: I can't believe she fell for it.
Even when I'm a bad mom, I'm a great mom.
It's amazing how I can get anything out of anyone.
The C.
I.
A.
should be all moms Moms like me basically just me.
- (Chuckles) - There it is.
I never told anybody that last part.
Thoughts? - (Grunts) - _ Which is they call it a devil's threesome Unless you're in Prague, where it's just called "sex.
" (Grunts) That is absolutely, positively everything, son.
See? This is good multitasking.
'Cause two shirtless dudes just standing around, talking about sex, starts to look weird after a while.
Oh, wait, dad.
Just one more thing.
Please, Barbell, just slip and fall on my throat.
(Grunts) I'm just wondering.
When should I start manscaping? It's patchy, but I feel like things are gonna get crazy down there.
Sometimes I look around the locker room to gauge where I am on the spectrum.
I think hunter Kang-Nussbaum caught me peeking.
Then the lunch lady popped into my head.
I'm not even attracted to her, but now I have to avoid her line.
She serves the tater tots, so that kills me! - I love tater tots.
- Dre: This is hell.
I hate to admit it, but pops may have been right.
I've created a sex-talking monster.
But the other day, I actually cried afterwards Not from sadness, just from a lot of emotions, you know? He's not even asking questions anymore Just brutal, unfiltered, nonstop oversharing.
You know who really gets me there? Helen Mirren.
Is that weird? You know what? I don't even care.
(Laughs) After four days of hearing Junior's innermost sexual thoughts, you can color me done.
But I can't hurt his feelings by telling him that.
Junior: Hey, dad? - Let's talk about sex - (Grunts) So I'll just do everything in my power - It keeps coming up anyhow - To avoid him at all costs.
- Don't decoy, avoid, or make void the topic - (Laughs) - 'Cause that ain't gonna stop it - Oh, my God.
- Dad? Dad.
Let's talk about sex baby - Hey, do you think we could talk about - Let's talk about you and me - (Snoring) Let's talk about all the good things and the bad things that may be let's talk about sex let's talk about sex let's talk about sex let's talk about sex Dre, what are you doing? Watching a movie on my phone, 'cause I'm hiding from my son.
What else would I be doing in the laundry room? - How long have you been in here? - How long is "The Godfather?" You know what? I can't judge you.
My mom game hit an all-time low with Zoey.
Could have been her bestie.
Completely blew it twice.
- Parenting is hard.
- Yeah.
Hey let's stay in here for the rest of the week.
You know what we could do while we're in here? What? Fold some clothes.
- I'm gonna go talk to Junior.
- What? (Sighs) Zoey? Hi.
Listen [Sighs.]
truth be told, because I was so excited about you telling me what was going on in your life, I have no idea what's going on in your life.
Yeah, I kind of picked up on that when you left me hanging for a week, so I talked to pops.
- You talked to pops? - Yeah, he gave me some awesome advice.
You should cherish him more.
Uh-huh.
Thank you, Zozo.
- Good night.
- Yeah.
Okay.
You have got to tell me what she said.
I have absolutely no idea.
I mean, I listened to her, gave her some generic advice in a deep, soothing voice.
I Morgan freeman-ed her.
- Hey.
- Oh, dad, I'm glad you're here.
- I've got some - Nope.
No.
I'm done.
Son, look, the last few days have been the most open and honest we've ever had And I hated it.
Hey, not you.
I love you.
Love you, son.
That's why I wanted to be a part of this.
I-I wanted to be in the loop But only for the big stuff.
I don't need the play-by-play.
- Oh, you mean like how I enjoy - Exactly.
Mnh.
Keep going to your mother with the day-to-day, all right? She lives for this stuff.
But the big stuff? I'm your guy.
I will always take my shirt off for you.
Um, dad, I talked to my friends about that, and that's not a thing.
Son It's our thing.
No, seriously, dad, it's weird.
Wow.
You're ninja-quiet.
I've been watching you, son Watching you try and connect up with Junior the last couple of days.
I have to say, it's embarrassing.
I hear you, pops.
What you're saying is, you regret never having the talk with me, which meant I didn't have the tools to have the talk with Junior.
That's not even close to what I'm saying.
I get it.
You were busy working hard, providing for us, and communicating openly with your kids wasn't a priority for your generation.
Could have made it a priority.
Chose not to.
But you're proud of me for trying.
(Sighs) Every day.
Wow.
That was a lot better than when he gave me a box of condoms.
So, Junior and pops Two moments of real personal growth.
Now, I know it might have been greedy, but I was gonna go for a third.
Dre this has gone too far.
- You haven't worn clothes for two days.
- Clothes are for suckers.
I'm gonna go outside and get the paper.
While you're out there, you might as well get the mail, too.
(Sighs) Do you realize we've gotten less attention in the last week by trying to get attention? I can't even get mom to comb my hair.
Well, if they're not gonna give us the talk, let's give it to each other.
We don't even know what the talk's about.
All I know is that you lower your voice [Deep voice.]
And sound serious.
I can do that.
(Normal voice) Okay.
Let's do it.
(Deep voice) Diane, I'd like to talk to you about the difference between jam and jelly.
- Now, I think - Unh.
Let me stop you right there.
You're boring me.

Dre: Funny thing about evolution Some species flourish in any environment.
Zoey, how the hell does everybody here know you but nobody knows your brother? [Chuckling.]
Bye, Dad.
And bye, kid who rides to school with me and who some may think resembles me but is in no way related to me.
- Hi.
- But some species struggle.
Oh, no! My hobbit shire! Son, why are we the only ones carrying an extra-credit project? Well, it's not extra credit, per se - More so extra acknowledgment.
- Ah.
You had me drive all the way to Azusa to get virgin wheat grass for an acknowledgment project? Your ass lucky we in public.
But the thing that always helps you through your struggle is having a sense of community.
Instead of treated, we get tricked Hey.
Why didn't you give that kid the nod? - The nod? - Yes, the nod To acknowledge that you've seen him.
- But I don't know him.
- What does that matter? You two have something in common.
Oh, my God.
You don't even know what you have in common, do you? No! My hobbit shire! SO1EO3 The Nod Pops, you should have seen it.
The boy just stared at him No nod, like his neck was broken.
Well, maybe something is wrong with his neck.
Did you ask him? - Something wrong with your neck, boy? - What? No.
I mean I don't think so.
Rainbow: So he didn't nod at somebody.
- I don't get what the big deal is.
- Of course you don't.
Look, babe, the nod is important.
It's the internationally accepted, yet unspoken, sign of acknowledgment of black folks around the world.
Thank you very much.
[Applause, camera shutters clicking.]
So, no matter who you are or where you're at, it's your duty to give the nod.
Even in the most extrem of circumstances, we always found a way to let each other know, "I see you, bruh.
" Dre, please do not turn this into yet another thing.
The truth is that Junior's generation has a different perspective on the struggle than you and pops.
Can't you just let that be a good thing? - No! - Okay.
Bow, the nod is on the same primal level as a baby waving "hi.
" - That's right.
- Uh-huh.
A as a man scrunching up his face when a woman with a big butt walks by.
- Ahh! - Whew! Oh, my God.
You don't do that, either? I have failed! - Pops - I'm sorry, Junior.
Much as I hate to admit it, my idiot son is right this time.
- This is basic stuff.
- Even the butt thing? Especially the butt thing basic black.
What Wow.
- Thank you, pops.
- Oh, you're welcome, son.
- You did hear me call you an idiot, yes? - Yes.
Noted.
Well, I've got a 7:30 online call for "ghost recon," so Hey, pops, we fought too hard for these kids.
- They have nothing left to struggle for.
- Can't that be a good thing? - No.
- No! Hey, Zoey, I was - Okay.
- I know, right? Like, she just comes up to me and starts talking.
That's what I have to deal with.
[Sighs.]
Hey, guys.
What you doin'? - Making posters for career day.
- Career day.
Ooh, career day.
Oh, my God.
I love that so awesome.
Jack, what are you drawing? It's me performing at the Rose Bowl in eight years.
I want to be a teen sensation.
- Is that a job? - You tell me.
Let me see.
- [Rae Sremmurd's "No Flex Zone" plays.]
- Whoo! Yeah! [Laughs.]
Boom! Can't argue with that.
No money? Is this a joke to you? No what? No flex zone [Sighs.]
Oh! Test tubes! Like mother, like daughter.
Those aren't test tubes.
- Oh.
- They're energy drinks for an ad campaign aimed at kids who are too young to drink energy drinks.
Hmm.
I want to work in advertising like dad.
Wait.
What do you mean? Wait, sweetheart, I thought you wanted to be a doctor like like mommy.
And wear the same thing to work every day.
Well hmm.
How long do you have to go to school to be a doctor? Well, there's four years of college and then there's four years of med school - and then three years of Okay.
- I'm gonna stop you right there.
Daddy just went to college, and he's got all three pair of yeezys.
Okay, I'm gonna level with you.
You are my only hope.
Zoey is obviously gonna marry well.
- Probably several times.
- Junior I mean, we're lucky if we get him out of the house before he's 30.
- [Singsong voice.]
Optimistic.
- And then there's Jack.
Hey no flex zone no flex zone - I know.
- Sweetheart I need you on this one.
Do you understand? Mnh-mnh.
So, I started to think that maybe I was making too big a deal of this whole nod thing and then it happened.
- What up, man? - Dre.
Dre Johnson, the big SVP.
I know who you are.
[Chuckles.]
Charlie Telphy.
They just brought me on as the new account manager.
- Oh.
Well, welcome, man.
- Yeah.
Hey, where'd they bring you from? Starbucks headquarter up in Seattle.
- It's rainy up there.
- Mm-hmm.
Wet and sad.
This move saved my life.
- Glad that happened for you, brother.
- Yeah, yeah.
Lot of bad stuff happened up there in Seattle.
Okay.
Well, look, I'll catch you later, brother.
Yeah, yeah, you will.
- U unless you heard something I don't know.
- L like what? Like they're gonna fire a brother right after hire.
- Uh no.
- They wouldn't do that, right? - You're cool, man.
Everything's all right.
- [Chuckles.]
'Cause I do my work.
- Uh, uh, okay.
Good.
- All right? - I'm-a see you around.
- Oh, okay.
All right.
- Yes, sir.
All right.
- Okay, cool.
- You good? - Yeah, I'm good.
You? - All right? [Chuckles.]
- Oh, again! [Chuckles.]
- All right, now.
- Yeah.
Nice guy.
I mean, he was a bit of a hugger and a double dapper, but who cares? We connected, and that's what I wanted for Junior.
I need to get my boy some of this.
Dre: White guy.
White guy.
White guy.
Wow.
There really are no black guys your age at your school.
- Hey.
What about him? - He's Filipino.
[Chuckles.]
I'm sure that's what his mother tells him.
- Hey, what about that dude? - Sri Lankan.
Not even a real place.
- [Gasps.]
What about him? - He's from Malawi.
Where's that? Africa.
Pass.
Why doesn't Zoey have to do this? I have black friends.
You know, I'm cool, plus I'm black, which is cool, so I win twice.
Wow.
The black pool at your school is very shallow.
- It is? I haven't noticed.
Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.
Of course he hadn't.
It wasn't Junior's fault.
This one was on me.
I'm the one who put him in that private school.
I had made him the fly in buttermilk, so it was up to me to make it right.
I was determined to find Junior some black friends.
Hey, boys.
You like chips and soda? Huh? W what are you 12? 13? No, no, no, no! No, no.
Nothing weird.
No, nothing weird.
Just looking for some young black boys to bring back to my house.
[Cellphone dials 911.]
Uh ma'am? Uh, after hearing that back in my head, you are doing the right thing.
I'm gonna roll off now.
- [Tires squeal.]
- All right.
Stupid child molesters.
Can't even invite kids back to your house for delicious snacks anymore.
Cheetos, chips, cheesy chips, and snickerdoodles.
What a waste.
I can't believe I bought all this stuff for nothing.
So, you were trolling for boys? I was not trolling.
I saw the best candidates, and I made my pitch Which, by the way, had that lady not been sitting there, would have resulted in us having three beautiful black boys in our home.
Problem solved.
- Uh - Hmm.
You're wearing the same thing again.
Oh.
Uh Shocking.
[Chuckles.]
Dre, we need a sensible method to find Junior some black friends that's not gonna result in your prosecution or imprisonment, okay? - [Gasps.]
- Oh! Oh! I've got it! - What? - Oh.
- Boom.
- The Leimert Social Club? - Yeah.
- [Scoffs.]
Sounds like a Bougie Club for rich black kids.
- Mnh-mnh.
- No, thank you.
No, no, no! They have get-togethers Uh, community outreach, cultural enrichment.
Sounds culty.
It's not culty, Dre.
Look! Look at this.
Black people gardening.
When was the last time you saw that? You mean besides our nation's 400 years of nonconsensual gardening? Okay, fine, so it may be not your thing, but it might be Junior's thing, so you just need to try it.
- All right.
- Anyway, I need to go to my very cool job where I save lives and get to wear Oh, whoa, whoa clogs and toe socks.
[Chuckling.]
What? Okay.
I'm not one to keep an open mind or listen to people, but I was desperate, so I decided to check out the Leimert Social Club.
So, we at Leimert Social Club have certain core values of service, leadership, and collegiality.
Tell us what you're looking to get out of your membership.
More black friends for my son.
[Chuckling.]
Okay.
I'm sure he'll make plenty of friends, but, specifically, what ways would you like to see him enriched? Mm.
Like, an overall blackening.
Think of the boy as a piece of salmon and your club as the Skillet.
Hmm.
I'm not sure you understand what we do.
Oh, no, no, no.
We know what you do.
Cotillions, special events, fundraisers, blah, blah, blah.
- Yeah, it's all right there.
- See, what we're interested in is the horde of black children you have.
Mm-hmm.
Well, we don't refer to our children as a horde.
- Oh, fair enough.
Fair enough.
- Oh.
But, for example, what concentration of black are we talking about? Yes.
Are we talking raw, uncut biggie black or Low-Cal Drake black? - Excellent question, son.
- Thank you, father.
So, as we came to the mutual agreement that the Leimert Social Club probably wasn't for us, Bow was attempting a little social engineering of her own.
I thought you said we were taking the day off of school to do fun stuff like get frozen yogurt.
We are doing fun stuff.
After I show you all the very cool stuff that I do here, we're gonna go downstairs to the cafeteria, and, because I'm a doctor, you're gonna get some free frozen yogurt.
Free or not, hospital yogurt is not how I saw my day going.
Huh.
So, look at this, Dee.
This is my workstation.
See, I put an I.
V.
into the patient's arm, and then I monitor their vitals During the procedure to make sure that they don't die.
- Mom.
- Huh? Do you know what's better than all this? - What? - Last week, at dad's job, Justin Bieber wrestled Kevin durant's dog for the rehearsal of a Nike commercial.
- The Rehearsal.
- Got it.
I make sure people don't die.
But at dad's job, they actually wrestle people.
- Mommy saves people.
Just saying.
- Can we go now? Meanwhile, I still needed to figure out how to help Junior, so I retreated to my favorite thinking spot.
Charlie: 'Sup, Dre? Executive washroom.
Nice! Good thing they never lock it.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa! Let's stop right here.
Does this guy not know urinal protocol? You start on the ends, always leaving a buffer.
See these two right here? These are your spacers.
They're just for show.
[Buzzer.]
They are never to be used under any circumstances.
And above all else, never make direct eye contact.
And you never I see you representin'.
Holding it Di-down over there.
[Chuckles.]
What are you Charlie What's up, Charlie? Oh, nothing, man.
You know, just trying to stay two steps ahead of the man.
- You dig? - Yeah.
What's wrong, Dre? You're looking pensive.
Oh.
Uh, maybe this is just my pee face.
No.
I know your pee face.
There's something else going on.
I don't know if it was because he knew my pee face or because I was desperate to change the subject, but I downloaded him on what was going on with me and Junior, and, believe it or not, Charlie had a pretty interesting take.
Look, all your son needs to do is understand the struggle.
- You get me? - Mm.
Take him back to the hood.
Charlie may not have known all the urinal decorum, - but he was a'ight.
- Whew! Whew.
Mnh-mnh-mnh.
So, wasn't lunch awesome? Yeah.
I love "warm" chicken-noodle soup.
Look.
This is our locked drug cabinet.
It is filled with very dangerous and very powerful narcotics, and there is only one key, and I have it.
[Clicks tongue.]
[Gasps.]
Oh, my God! How long has this been like this? They're gonna take my key from me.
Woman on P.

I'll be right back.
You stay with him, okay? - Hi.
- Hey.
[Sighs.]
I like your glasses.
Thank you.
[Indistinct shouting.]
Dre: Ahhhhh.
This is it, son.
Look at that.
Look at that.
This is the place that made me.
Being here will teach you everything you need to know about the struggle.
A kid in the bathroom asked me if I wanted to buy a police car.
Ahh.
The lessons have already begun.
And some of the best lessons you'll ever learn will be right here on this court.
Look at this pickup game.
Definition of instant camaraderie Five strangers coming together to form one team.
We got to get you out on the court, son.
Come on.
Yo! We got next! Yeah, stretch it out, son.
What the hell are you doing? Pilates.

You're yelling at me for Junior getting tomahawked on.
- You took Diane to the hospital.
- She saw a tomahawk in somebody's skull! I know! I know! Oh, my God! I traumatized our daughter.
Diane's broken, and Junior telegraphs his passes.
Mm.
Here it comes! - We're horrible parents.
- Horrible.
[Microwave beeps.]
Dre: Oh.
Hey, Rachel.
What's up, Charlie? Dre! What's up, baby? Oh, my God.
Heaven on a spoon.
Mm.
You got to try this.
[Chuckles.]
You know, I'm not a big soup sharer, brother.
I'm good.
No, you're not, and I ain't about to have you being mad at me for not making you try this.
- Now open up.
Get some.
- Hey, hey, Charlie Hard pass, man.
All right, you need to pump your brakes.
All right, player.
I'm I'm pumping.

No worries.
Sorry, man.
Hey.

Okay, that's cool, brother.
No later than 8:30.
- Hey, Charlie? - 9:00? - Pump your brakes.
- I'm pumping.
I'm pumping, brother.
[Chuckles.]
No later than 10:00.
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.
You know, I've been meaning to talk to you.
I was so excited to bring you to the hospital, but I'm really sorry that you You saw all those terrible, terrible things.
I saw a man with a hatchet - I know.
- In his head.
It was Awesome! E-excuse me? And that guy with coyote bites sweet! Oh and you said sometimes people die, and it could be the Doctor's fault, but no one can actually say so for sure.
- Right? - W - Right? - Right.
Technically, that is true.
Hmm.
I definitely want to be a doctor.
Definitely.
I'm gonna go tell Jack.
He'll be so jealous! Yes! Ohhhhhh! [Doorbell rings.]
Dad, do we really have to do this? I was kind of hoping that my first blind date would be with a girl.
Yeah, I was kind of hoping you wouldn't need a blind date.
[Chuckles.]
It's okay, sweetie.
Hey, hey! What's happening, Dre? - How you doing, man? [Chuckles.]
- All right.
- Hi, there.
- Hi.
- You must be Rainbow.
- I am.
- I brought you some flowers.
- Oh! How nice! - It's so lovely.
- Oh.
- It's a wrist corsage.
- Nice.
[Chuckles.]
This is my son, Eustace.
Uh, we call him "Useless.
" [Laughter.]
You're the only one who calls me that.
[Chuckles.]
That's 'cause I love you! [Laughter.]
And you don't do a whole lot.
Okay.
Have you have you eaten already? What? The, uh Oh.
It's just burgers.
- Nothing much.
Just burgers.
- O-okay.
Hey, son, why don't you go kick it with your new black friend, all right? - Take him upstairs.
- [Chuckles.]
Uh, so, is there a Mrs.
Telphy, or? Oh.
Actually, we, uh We're going through a pretty nasty divorce right now.
- Hmm.
- Oh.
Eustace: You are? Uh Just go upstairs and play! - [Chuckles.]
- [Chuckles.]
- All right, well, let's let's go into - All right.
Yeah, let's go get comfortable.
- Sure.
Can I take that burger? - No.
No.
- Oh.
Okay.
- Oh.
You know, when your wife cheats on you Mm.
Then shoots you You'd think you'd feel angry.
And I did.
But I also felt inadequate.
Everything shut down.
All this stuff down here stopped working a long time ago.
Oh.
All right.
- Yeah.
Now I know why they call it "junk.
" - [Chortles.]
Rainbow: Okay.
Mm.
Hmm.
Well I think that, uh, meatloaf is chasing that burger to the exit, if you know what I'm talking about.
- You know what I'm saying.
- I do now.
Um, which bathroom is no one using for the rest of the night? Whichever one you use.
All right.
- Yeah, yeah.
- Top of the stairs, to the left.
Top of the steps? I'll find it.
If I don't, y'all got a problem, right? [Laughter.]
So, your friend seems nice.
Okay, babe, Charlie isn't for everybody.
Charlie isn't for anybody.
Not only were we verbally accosted, he has no boundaries.
He showed us jpegs of his rectal polyps.
Which were benign.
Babe Showing empathy towards Charlie is a part of the struggle.
I'm tired of the struggle.
Look, babe, Charlie may have some idiosyncrasies, but if this is what it takes to get Junior a new black friend, so be it.
Okay, fine.
Dre! Dre! - Hmm? - Look what I found in your closet.
O.
G.
Air 1s! Huh?! Oh no.
Please take my shoes off.
And they feel like you ain't never wore these before.
- [Chuckles.]
- Please take my shoes off.
- And guess what.
- Please take my shoes off.
Just guess! And you're not wearing socks? And we wear the same size! Huh? Hey.
Eustace.
It's time to go.
Your dad is ready to go right now.
Come on.
[Snaps fingers.]
Immediately! Hang on, Dad.
We're on the verge of a breakthrough.
Ain't nobody got time for that! You ain't got no more black friends at my house! Let's go, Eustace! What were you gonna say? Just, we should coat the bridge with moss to slick it up.
That way, the orcs can't cross into Rivendell.
Junior: How did I not think of that? Give me some! Both: Yass, gaga, yass! [Both chuckle.]
Dre: And it was at that moment I realized that struggle comes in a lot of different forms.
Junior's was just different than mine.
But no matter what your fight, you still need your community.
It's the hard knock life for us And you need to let them know, "I see you, bruh.
" And for Junior, nerd is the new black.
Sorry, Orange.
There you go.
Scrunch, son.
Ooh.
Scrunch it.
All right hey, no, no, no, no, no.
Just do what comes natural.
Just lighten up a little bit.
You're not scared.
You're not scared.
Oh.
Here comes another one.
Lock and load, son.
Lock - Okay.
Okay.
- Oh, yeah.
Good form.
Good form, Junior.
Yeah! He's a natural! [Chuckles.]
Is it okay if I cuss? Sure.
Damn.
[Chuckles.]
[Chuckles.]
That's exactly what I said when I met your mama.
Yeah, come to think of it, me too.

Gracias.
To put it mildly, credit hasn't always been the easiest thing for a black man to get, whether it's a credit-card application, the birth of rock 'n' roll, or civilization itself.
But as hard as it's been to get credit for those things, it's even harder to get credit from your wife.
Babe? Yeah.
Look I loaded the dishwasher.
Uh-huh.
Babe, are you not seeing what I'm seeing? Everything is exactly where it's supposed to be.
You killed it, Dre.
They didn't believe in you, but you did it.
Silence the haters.
Cheese! Look at my babies.
Yeah, Dre, you killed it.
Look, I'm just trying to do my part.
You know, being a modern husband, I can bring home the bacon and wash out the pan.
Are you trying to get credit for simply loading the dishwasher? Mm-hmm.
Sure sounds like it.
I should've stopped right there.
It was like watching myself in a horror movie at the Magic Johnson theater.
Don't go in there, fool! There's an argument in there! I've seen this one before, man.
He goes in there.
This guy is stupid.
Watch.
I'm not trying to get credit.
I'm just not not trying to get credit.
Told you he was stupid.
No argument here.
Licorice? Oh, thanks.
Damn.
So, let me get this straight.
I've cooked dinner, corrected homework.
I'm making the lunches for tomorrow, I talked a first-year resident through a really tough intubation, in espaÃ±ol, and you are trying to get credit for Oh, look at this.
Unh, unh, unh, unh, unh, unh, unh! Handles out.
- Oh, boy.
Okay.
- All right? I'm just trying to do my part around here, baby.
W-with all this new responsibility at work, I'm not gonna always be able to step up like this.
"Step up"? Mm! Mm! Pops! Yo! Your paper is killing me, man.
Well, how else will you know that I was here to witness you unravel the fabric of your marriage, son? Okay, look, I'm just saying, now that I'm SVP, I'm gonna probably have to dial it back some You know, do a little less.
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry.
Did I say something funny? Um, well, you said "less.
" But, baby, that's physically impossible.
What? I help out! Listen, we both have huge jobs, but when I come home from mine from, you know, saving lives and whatnot, I start a whole other second huge job.
When you come home, you play video games.
Babe, that is ridiculous! That's the sound it makes when I get a work e-mail.
You have lost this round.
Playing time 4 hours, 13 minutes.
New record! Okay.
Maybe I have a little problem.
Just a little bit.
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, babe.
- Mom.
- Yeah.
I forgot to tell you last week, but Jack and I need two dozen cupcakes for school tomorrow.
Yeah, that's 23 cupcakes.
Tomorrow? Oh, great.
That sounds fun for me.
And be careful with the frosting.
Last time you made some, it looked like you did them last-minute.
Yeah, you kind of phoned it in, mom.
Did you even hear what she said? Yes.
She said, "hey, Dad.
" Um, and then she said something to you.
Mm.
That's what I'm talking about.
I mean, there's like a thousand invisible things that I do around here that aren't even on your radar.
Okay, babe, I hear you.
Let me tell you what.
Let me handle all the kids' stuff this week, I-including whatever it is that Diane just said.
- Really? - Yes, really.
That would be great.
I could really use a break.
I know.
You know, you look tired.
I look tired, Dre? Mm-hmm.
Oh, look what's here in the paper.
Your obituary.
Mr.
Johnson! To what do we owe the surprise? Oh, well, I-I wouldn't say it was a surprise.
You know, I've been here many times.
Nuh-unh.
Daddy, you've never been here, ever.
Uhp shut up, boy.
Put your bag away.
You know, he has a problem with his short-term memory.
How's he doing? Is everything okay? You're Jack and Diane's Dad? Yes.
I'm just dropping off cupcakes.
You're amazing! My husband never drops off cupcakes.
Mine either.
Except in his mouth.
Fatty.
Oh.
All right, nice seeing you, ladies.
Uh, I must be going.
Oh, no, no, no! Stay, stay! Dads never make cupcakes.
Well, I didn't make these.
You know, these are store-bought.
Oh! I love store-bought! Which is much more expensive than homemade cupcakes.
Great! Maybe I can stay for a minute.
Who wants some cupcakes? Oh! If I had known that bringing in some cupcakes would get me treated like a rock star, I would've tried this hands-on-parenting thing a long time ago.
When you wish upon a star your dreams will take you very far, yeah you're a shining star no matter who you are shining star for you to see what your life can truly be shining star for you to see what your life can truly be While I was killing it at school, - I also knew I was nailing it at home.
- Aww! Oh, my God.
My fridge is chaos.
Apples with applesauce? Chips in the fridge? Oh, my God! Hi.
Cindee.
I-I need you to move my heart/lung consult.
I have a real emergency.
Lettuce on the top shelf.
My poor fridge.
Who did this to you? Oh! So, when people see mustaches now, they think hipster, not Hitler.
And that, people, is the power of creative rebranding.
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late for a meeting that I'm running.
Had a thing with my kids.
Nice move, bro.
Hands-on Dad way to go, Dre.
Family first here at Stevens & Lido.
Always.
Starts and ends with the old fam-o! Give me a minute to get things together.
Sorry I'm late.
My kid was sick.
It took me forever to get out of the house.
Ah.
No problem.
A little heads-up next time would be great, Candace.
Wow.
Candace, you're better than this.
It turned out to be a good day to be a Dad who cared.
Everywhere I went, people were bringing the love.
I've been receiving e-mails about my cupcakes all day.
"Thanks for stepping up today.
" You're welcome.
"You made everybody's day.
" I try.
Hey, "best cupcakes ever.
" They were tasty.
That's a lot of e-mails for a tray of cupcakes.
- Mommy, mommy, look! - Hey, sweetie.
The whole class made Dad "thank you" cards! They're calling him "Cupcake Man.
" What?! No! "Number-one Dad.
We love you, Mr.
J.
" And you're wearing a cape in this one.
- I am Cupcake Man.
- Right.
Yeah, saving the world through cupcakes that I bought at a liquor store.
Ha ha! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Liquor-store cupcakes, and you're a hero? Yes.
I made those ungrateful runts quiche with green eggs and ham for Dr.
Seuss day, and I got nothing nothing! I could see she was upset, and all I had to do to make her feel better was to tell her how much I appreciate her.
Well, babe Everyone can't be Cupcake Man.
When I say "cup," you say "cake" - Cup! Cup! - Cake! Cake! When I say "cup," you say "cake" - Cup! Cup! - Cake! Cake! Do the birdie! Come on! Un-freakin'-believable.
Do the birdie down the hall! Do the birdie! Do the sheneneh! Mm! Walk with it! Roll with it! Dummy did it again, man! Mm.
This time, he's gonna die.
I thought for day 2 of stepping up, I'd build on my success as Cupcake Man and introduce my new alter ego, Pancake Guy.
Who wants some extra-chocolate-chip pancakes? Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, syrup for breakfast.
What's next uh, diabetes for dinner? Unh-unh! Those are mine.
Hey, guys, I'm glad you like my pancakes, but I hear your mother coming down the stairs, so please, let's try not to make too big a deal out of what's clearly a big deal.
- Good morning! - Good morning.
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.
Wow.
- Dad made chocolate-chip pancakes.
- Out of diabetes.
Wow! That's a treat.
They look delicious.
Mm they're okay.
Hm.
You guys, go get your book bags.
Yeah, go get your book bags.
- Hey, babe? - Yes? I just want to say I'm sorry about last night.
Oh.
I did get caught up in all of the attention.
I was just mainly frustrated 'cause I feel like moms do everything and no one ever notices and then Dads do one little thing - and people go crazy.
- Mm.
But you know what I realized last night? That you can't drink a half a bottle of wine in the tub and get out without help? And that I have a very helpful husband.
And now I have a lot more time to enjoy myself.
Mm.
Mm.
Mwah.
Maybe a little bit of you later.
Mmm.
Oh! I was enjoying my breakfast over here.
By the way, these health forms need to go in today, and if you want, I can fill it out 'cause I've got it down to a science.
Babe.
What? I got it.
Well, I could hey! I got it.
Okay, great.
- Now go enjoy yourself.
- Okay.
Mm.
You are not a very smart man, son.
What? This whole "freaky Friday" role-reversal thing you got going on.
Dads and moms have different roles for a very good reason.
When I was married to your mother, for example, - I was the provider.
- Mm-hmm.
She, the unquenchable bonfire that consumed my time, money, and youth.
Pops, Bow and I are different.
We help each other.
Oh.
You heard what she said, now? Okay, great! In that cartoon-princess voice.
When a woman says that, she's not happy.
She doesn't like this new setup you got arranged, and you're not gonna like it, either.
How are you gonna tell me how I feel, man? Pops, I'm fine.
Okay, Captain Cupcake or Mr.
Pancake Whatever you call yourself.
It's "Pancake Guy.
" Or "Pancake Dude.
" I ain't figured out which one it is yet, but it's gonna be Well, make up your mind! Who cares what pops said? I was looking forward to what kind of props I was gonna get today.
Boom! Filled out those health forms for you.
Oh, great.
Thank you.
And? And what? Uh, well, you know, there were a lot of little boxes there that required some very fine printing.
- Okay.
- You're welcome.
You know, just trying to go that extra mile.
By doing what's mandatory? Uh w hey, that's me! Hey, come here.
- Hey, Ms.
Davis! - Hey, kids! Hey, uh Oh, hey, everybody! It's Cupcake Man.
Hey, Jack's Dad! What did you bring today? Health forms! Okay, everybody circle up! Today, we're starting our unit on Harriet Tubman.
Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, hey.
Speaking of going the extra mile, if you need a little extra help with H-Tubs here, I'm your guy.
W-why do you think I need extra help? Well, because I'm And you're A doctoral candidate in American history with a concentration in the civil war? Who happens to be First in her class? Uh, who is also Published? Very white.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
I'm not.
Being white is awesome.
I study American history, so I should know.
I'm kidding.
We're the worst.
- Oh.
- Okay! Slavery! That cupcake glory didn't last long, did it? I remember my first high.
I made homemade cotton candy for spring carnival.
I thought the praise would never end.
I quit my day job.
I'm sorry.
You are? - Stacy Kang-Nussbaum.
- Yeah, okay.
Let me tell you what's gonna happen here.
The more you do, the more you get taken for granted, so don't bother to buckle up.
It's a slow ride to nowhere.
Thank you, but I'm good.
Oh, you think so?! So, it's a fairly routine procedure, uh, but with your medical history, there is a significant risk for I'm sorry.
Just give me one second, if you would.
Oh, it's my daughter.
Hey, baby.
Hey, mom.
Hey! I forgot my gym bag.
Oh! Never mind force of habit.
I'll call Dad.
I'd be happy to Okay, where were we? Uh, let's see here Blah, blah, "significant risk.
" You'll be fine.
Just, I'm gonna thanks.
You can go.
So, while I was plotting my next move as an involved Dad, Bow had free time to enjoy herself, which is not always easy for Bow.
Hey, babies.
Need any help with your spelling words? Nope.
Dad already quizzed us.
We don't need you.
Oh.
Knock-knock.
Hey! Want to go hit a bunch of balls? What does that mean? I don't know.
It just seems like something I've heard people say, so Is that No.
Okay.
Hey.
Hey.
I was just wondering if, you know, you want to Just talk about anything special You know, just girl-to-girl.
Gross.
Okay.
For me, day 2 of stepping up had not gone as planned.
I needed to really bring it tomorrow if I was gonna stay in the game.
Need a win here, Dre.
Back's against the wall, bruh.
Hey! So, the kids are busy, and I'm not doing anything, so I was wondering Are you hand-grinding cornmeal? Yeah, babe.
This corn bread's got to be spectacular.
It's for the Harriet Tubman presentation tomorrow, and I will not be ignored.
Well, it looks great.
You know what else looks great? Like that? Yeah.
I like that.
I like it.
Babe Hey, babe, you know, that teacher was mean to me.
I filled the hell out of those forms, and she's like, "good.
Get out.
" Like I didn't even exist.
Mm.
Well, if you're not in the mood, you can just Babe huh? I'm baking.
Hey! Guess who made authentic, hand-ground corn bread.
OKay.
Just put it over there, Dre.
Mr.
Kinnebrew made kettle corn for everyone.
You rock, Glen! I'm just doing my part for the Harriet Tubman experience.
Here you go.
Go get 'em! Who's the showboat? Some jackass Dad.
No one's even noticed my cardboard replica of Harriet Tubman's one-room cabin.
If you look in the window, there's a tiny marzipan map of Canada on the wall.
Woman, what the hell are you talking about? It's aspirational.
I wanted to be gracious and rise above it, but as the next minute and 37 seconds will show, that's not exactly how it went down.
Okay, class, it is time to start our special show.
Good afternoon, chil'ren.
My name is Harriet Tubman.
I was born in 1820 in a one-room cabin Look at that.
Look at him sitting over there like he's a prince.
Popcorn on the underground rail road? Please.
Harriet was a smart woman.
She wouldn't blow the whole deal with some loud-ass snacks.
Okay, Mr.
Johnson.
What?! You need to be quiet.
You're ruining the Harriet Tubman experience.
- Oh, I'm ruining it? - Yeah.
I'm here to save it.
You're the one that's ruining it by allowing off-topic snacks and spreading misinformation.
For five whole days.
Harriet Tubman was not a spy.
Yes, she was! No, she wasn't! Excuse me! Who's talkin'? I am! Harriet, could you help a brother out over here and solve something for us? You were never a spy, right? Why, yes.
I was.
What does she know? She ain't even the real Harriet Tubman.
Oh! - The accusations! - Accu what?! All this rigamarole is aggravatin' the headaches - what the hell is "rigamarole"? - And dizzy spells I've had ever since a slave owner hit me in the head with an iron weight in 1835.
Oh! You're hurting Harriet Tubman! Boy, that is not the real Harriet Tubman! She said she was born in 1820! What's today date?! Do the math! What are y'all looking at? Oh.
He's crazy.
Shut up, Glen! You should leave! What?! I should leave? Who gave you cupcakes, huh? Who gave you cupcakes?! With a carefully worded, furious e-mail, I calmly let the authorities at school know the injustice I had suffered.
In many ways, I was just like Harriet Tubman The real one, not the fake-ass spy one.
Dre! Kitchen, babe.
What in the world did you do at school today? I stood up for parents everywhere.
We need to be respected and valued.
That teacher didn't even thank me for what I did.
For attacking Harriet Tubman? What was I supposed to do? - Oh, my - Teaching our kids nonsense like Harriet Tubman was a spy in the civil war.
She was a spy.
Her code name was "Moses.
" And how do you know this? Because it was in the packet that Ms.
Davis sent home.
Yeah, a packet that she probably wrote! Oh, my God.
You have become the crazy mom.
You realize that, right? It's no longer Stacy Kang-Nussbaum.
It's you.
You're crazy mom.
You know, if anyone's crazy, it's you.
- What? - Zoey told me what you did.
You sat on her bed.
Who does that? Okay, let's not change the subject, okay? No, we are talking about you.
You are a praise junkie.
Uh And you are a control freak.
What?! Yes! Excuse me.
Don't think I didn't notice you re-put away all the silverware.
You told me that you wanted me to do it, but you don't want me to do it.
No, no, I want you to do it.
I just want you to do it how I do it.
That's crazy! Okay, look No, it's not crazy.
Look, okay.
'Cause this is the way it's supposed to be, okay? It's supposed to be big fork, little fork, big spoon, little spoon.
You put it in here big fork, big spoon, little fork, little spoon like a maniac.
And now it's chaos all up in the drawer.
I'm being abused for working hard, just like Harriet Tubman.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no! Who Who would put a spatula with a can opener? Huh? Huh? That's a lunatic! You're a lunatic because Mommies need to be with their babies, Dre! What is going on out here, son? I can hear you all the way out to the guest house, where I am trying to entertain a lady friend.
Bow is being unreasonable, man.
Bow is being a mom.
The problem is, you're trying to be a mom, too, and you're being all crazy with it, yelling at teachers for teaching, forks and spoons all Willy-Nilly.
I-I know.
Can't handle it! See, there? "Freaky Friday.
" And you didn't even get that far into the week.
Nothing sadder than a freaky Thursday, son nothing.
Okay, pops, I get it.
I messed up, all right? You know what? I-I'm just gonna go talk to Bow.
Do that.
Lose what little dignity you have left.
So you don't think I should say anything? I think sometimes talking is overrated.
The way I see it, crazy got you in.
Crazy can get you out.
Later.
Pops doesn't always make a lot of sense, but in this case, he was right.
I needed to make a big move.
Mom, will you make us breakfast? I can't take any more of Dad's pancakes.
Too much sugar.
Miss your steel-cut oatmeal.
Well, Dad was actually It's so good.
We hate flavor.
Okay, babies.
I'll make you breakfast.
Hey mom? Mm-hmm? I'm really looking forward to spending some more time with you together.
Oh.
Wha That's so nice And a little strange.
Go! Hey, mom.
You want to sit on my bed later? Wha sure.
Awesome.
Okay.
Good morning, everybody! Dad, do you mind if mom takes us to school this morning? Son, that's what this whole week was about Giving your mother a break.
Please? It's so slow and safe.
We love listening to your books on tape.
What? It's Really, babe? What? You could've at least had them rehearse a little more.
That was like some really bad theater.
I know.
So, you want things to go back the way they were? Maybe a little.
It's not as easy as you thought, is it? - No, it's not, babe.
You know what? - No.
To hell with being the unsung hero.
I want to be sung.
Well, as much as I hate to admit it, I actually miss doing the little things.
And it kind of burns off my working-mom guilt.
Just sayin'.
Babe, babe.
Hmm? I appreciate everything that you do.
I appreciate everything you don't do.
Oh, hey, when you get home from work later, I know you might be tired, but I was thinking maybe you could - Oh.
You gonna sneak me in the underground rail road? - Mm-hmm.
You be Harriet Tubman.
I'll be Frederick douglass.
- Done! - All right.
Ha ha! Done! Done! - Let me get the wig.
- Oh! This is nice.
I'll wash the glasses.
Offering to do the dishes? You're trying to seduce me, Mr.
Johnson.
I am.
Oh.
Mmm.
You know, this has a very happy ending if he doesn't blow it.
Oh, no, he's gonna blow it.
Yeah.
Probably.
