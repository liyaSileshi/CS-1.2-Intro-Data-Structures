Neither of us said anything for the rest of Support Group. At the end, we all had to hold hands, and Patrick led us in a prayer. "Lord 
Jesus Christ, we are gathered here in Your heart, literally in Your heart, as cancer survivors. You and You alone know us as we know 
ourselves. Guide us to life and the Light through our times of trial. We pray for Isaac's eyes, for Michael's and Jamie's blood, for Augustus's 
bones, for Hazel's lungs, for James's throat. We pray that You might heal us and that we might feel Your love, and Your peace, which passes 
all understanding. And we remember in our hearts those whom we knew and loved who have gone home to you: Maria and Kade and Joseph 
and Haley and Abigail and Angelina and Taylor and Gabriel and . . ." 

It was a long list. The world contains a lot of dead people. And while Patrick droned on, reading the list from a sheet of paper because it 
was too long to memorize, I kept my eyes closed, trying to think prayerfully but mostly imagining the day when my name would find its way 
onto that list, all the way at the end when everyone had stopped listening. 

When Patrick was finished, we said this stupid mantra together— LIVING OUR BEST LIFE TODAY— and it was over. Augustus Waters 
pushed himself out of his chair and walked over to me. His gait was crooked like his smile. He towered over me, but he kept his distance so I 
wouldn't have to crane my neck to look him in the eye. "What's your name?" he asked.
